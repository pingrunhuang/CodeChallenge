# Problem

Professor Shekhu has another problem for Akki today. He has given him three positive integers A, N and P and wants him to calculate the remainder when AN! is divided by P. As usual, N! denotes the product of the first N positive integers.

# Input

The first line of the input gives the number of test cases, T. T lines follow. Each line contains three integers A, N and P, as described above.

# Output

For each test case, output one line containing Case #x: y, where x is the test case number (starting from 1) and y is the answer.

# Limits

1 ≤ T ≤ 100.
Small dataset

1 ≤ A ≤ 10.
1 ≤ N ≤ 10.
1 ≤ P ≤ 10.
Large dataset

1 ≤ A ≤ 105.
1 ≤ N ≤ 105.
1 ≤ P ≤ 105.
