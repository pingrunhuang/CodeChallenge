### Big O notation:
	* O(1): constant
	* O(N): linear
	* O(logN): logarithmic, searching a binary search tree(divide and conquer).
	* O(NlogN):  just n log n, quick sort
	* O(n 2 ) quadratic: e.g. bubble sort.
### LinkedList

LinkedList is good for unknown number of element to store.
Singly LinkedList is used when you only want to perform basic insertion.
Doubly LinkedList is used for backwards and forwards traversal.

### BinarySearchTree
traversal through BinarySearchTree in breadth first is using the queue to store the node.
Insertion ,deletion and lookup are with logarithmic. However the traversal operation is linear which is just like a LinkedList. Only with balanced BinarySearchTree can achieve the traversal operation with logarithmic.

### Heap
Heap is like Tree data structure. Min Heap strategy means the root of the tree is with the smallest value(the opposite goes to max heap strategy).

### Quicksort
(Nice blog about quicksort)[http://interactivepython.org/courselib/static/pythonds/SortSearch/TheQuickSort.html]
